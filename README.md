This cult believes that after death they are judged by Aeternus, if they are deemed worthy to be Aeternus’s disciple on the day of reckoning when all souls will be absorbed.

The only way to save the souls of the damned is to kill all six of radian's disciples to collect all 6 forbidden artifacts to assemble the gate of death to then kill radian and get his heart. You must then place his heart in the shrine that you see at the start to get everyone's souls back.
