# Lost Cities

In this game you play as **Rei**. Rei is the last person across 6 existing dimensions, Rei has to save the souls of every person who has been absorbed by the ancient god of death “**aeternus**” who was named and is worshiped by the prisoners of mortality. 

This cult believes that after death they are judged by **radian**, if they are deemed worthy to be aeternus’s disciple on the day of reckoning when all souls will be absorbed. 

The only way to save the souls of the damned is to kill all six of radian's disciples to collect all 6 forbidden artifacts to assemble the gate of death to then kill radian and get his heart. You must then place his heart in the shrine that you see at the start to get everyone's souls back.
